A great advantage of being an E&I engineer is it gives you plenty of options to choose in your career. You can decide/change your career any day in your life, you can be an IT specialist or work as an embedded system developer or turn your focus towards power electronics, VLSI and design an hardware systems or robots, and ofcourse you would be left out with options in Instrumentation and there you can choose your career to work in PLC, SCADA etc. I graduated in the year 2012 but still my interest on electronics never dies. To be honest, I am not working in designing any electornics hardware or developing an embedded system but I worked as an IOT specialist to migrate sensor data to cloud and now working as data analyst with IOT data. Here its sensor but it could be PLC/SCADA data or any other real time data. In real life, when you say you're an engineer you must be knowing basics of various fields. Definitely E&I is one among the course which gives you an option to study the basics of electronics, electricals, computer systems, embedded systems, sensors, transducers, instrumentations, PLC, SCADA, control systems etc.
